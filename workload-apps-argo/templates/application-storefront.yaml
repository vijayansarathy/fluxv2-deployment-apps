#
# The Application CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a deployed application instance in an environment. 
# It is defined by two key pieces of information:
# 'source' - reference to the desired state in Git (repository, revision, path, environment)
# 'destination' - reference to the target cluster and namespace. 
# When deployed within a cluster, 'destination' is set to 'server' with the URL https://kubernetes.default.svc

  # Automatically sync an application when differences are detected between the desired manifests in Git, and the live state in the cluster
  # A benefit of automatic sync is that CI/CD pipelines no longer need direct access to the Argo CD API server to perform the deployment. 
  # Instead, the pipeline makes a commit and push to the Git repository with the changes to the manifests in the tracking Git repo
