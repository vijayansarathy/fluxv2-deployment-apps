#
# The Application CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a deployed application instance in an environment. 
# It is defined by two key pieces of information:
# 'source' - reference to the desired state in Git (repository, revision, path, environment)
# 'destination' - reference to the target cluster and namespace. 
# When deployed within a cluster, 'destination' is set to 'server' with the URL https://kubernetes.default.svc
